						<h3>About Episode 1</h3>

						<h3>About the Series</h3>
						<p>Provocative, edgy, humorous, racy, thought-provoking, and full of wonder all describe The Princess of the Bottom of the World, a seven-episode series of multimedia novellas focusing on the natural world and international adventure.</p>
						<p>Though a work of fiction, The Princess of the Bottom of the World is based on the author’s true adventures to Antarctica and the surrounding regions, time living abroad in Argentina, work with science and engineering, and nearly two decades of professional writing about the only world that we can call home.</p>
						<p>Scott Sullivan must travel to the coldest and most remote place on Earth to warm his heart to love. He journeys to Antarctica and other distant regions to study and write about wildlife and environmental issues. For far too long he has put his personal life on ice.</p>
						<p>Nothing could have prepared him for the spellbinding beauty and heart-wrenching reality he encounters. During the voyage he befriends a quirky crew member who begins the melting process on his heart. In his search to better understand the world, he unexpectedly finds a better understanding of himself.</p>
						<p>But at the end of the voyage, Scott and Cassandra are forced to go their separate ways. When a shipwreck draws them back together, Scott makes his own course correction.</p>

						<h3>Praise for The Princess of the Bottom of the World</h3>
						<p>"I loved going on the journey with Scott and the group. I was brought so close to the land and the wildlife by Scott’s descriptions, which can only be accomplished by someone with a heart invested in them. This beautiful travelogue swept me away."<i> —Mary Ackerman (nurse practitioner and book club member)</i></p>
						<p>"I especially like Melina and Cassandra, who were both hard working, smart, personable, independent, risk takers, passionate, uninhibited, playful, and lived in the moment."<i>—Connie Clark (dean of health sciences and book club member)</i></p>
						<p>"This is a great story! It was an adventure from the start! I like Scott, young and old, for his gumption and romanticism and resourcefulness and adventuresomeness, his humor and playfulness, his combination of regard for safety and protocols with his occasional interest in ignoring those very things. I like his sensuality and brains."<i>—Mary Rakow (author and editor)</i></p>
						<p>"The Princess of the Bottom of the World reads like a collaboration between Paul Theroux, Rachel Carson, and Robert James Waller."<i>—Dan Bergmann (scientist and educator)</i></p>
						<p>"Scott’s narrative voice is compelling, and imparts so much personality that I felt like I had gone on the expedition with him. And I was definitely craving Malbec (one of my favorite wines, too) the entire time!"<i>—Deborah Steinberg (writer and editor)</i></p>
						<p>"It’s really wonderful how strongly you express Scott’s emotions and excitement over every glacier. And all his descriptions are so vivid, right down to the feathers of the black-browed albatross. Whew, it’s a powerful ending and I am still crying!"<i>—Gail Cheeseman (cofounder of Cheesemans’ Ecology Safaris)</i></p>
